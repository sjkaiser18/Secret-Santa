A program to help us with calculating which cousin will be each's Secret Santa for Christmas. 

To Compile/Run:

Open up your Command Line Interface (this is called terminal on a Mac and Command Line on Windows). 

Navigate to wherever you got this program from, I like to drag it onto my desktop and then call:

cd Desktop

And then, navigate to this folder by calling:

cd Secret-Santa

Once inside, you will input the following command into the command line:

g++ santa.cpp -o merryxmas

and then:

./merryxmas

And then the program will run a create a text file inside the folder called "cousins_secret_santa.txt." Note that this file will be randomized every time, so one person will send it to the rest of the adults so they can know what to do.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
